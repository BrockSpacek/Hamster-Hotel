Hamster Hotel
Description: Created a webpage based off the figma of a hotel for hamsters including amenities, rooms, packages, and more. The page is responsive for tablet as well however it is not responsive for phone. 

Notes: The desktop version is set for a width of 1920px. Also I had some major github issues so this is a new repo.

Peer Reviewer: Chris Wells-Hott

Comments: Great job making a desktop version, keep practicing with bootstrap and media queries.
